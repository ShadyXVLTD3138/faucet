# KSM Faucet

Due to high demand, as well as spammers causing problems for regular users, the Kusama faucet has been shut down. Web3 Foundation will consider new ways to distribute KSM for people who need KSM to build.

If you are interested in obtaining KSM now for building or research, you can apply through the Treasury, receive a tip, or reach out to the Web3 Foundation for a grant.

### Support:
